# Jigsaw Puzzle Solver

In this project, we implemented an algorithm that solves Jigsaw Puzzles. In the document attached, we will present the algorithms that we used and the thinking process that led to the solution we implemented. In addition, we will present the price functions we used and the solution based on object-oriented programming in order to simplify the problem and achieve an optimal solution. We will present a detailed analysis of the solution trajectory calculated up to the final solution implemented.

Input:

Puzzle pieces on a solid green background:
